Feedback from S1

- If you don't have anyone in region, no point asking second question
- Make URL for website clickable, make email/phone numbers clickable
- Avoid gross line break in printout, tell word to not paginate
- Repeat row headers on each new page
- Make dark purple bar update when reviewing questions (consistent and clear)
- Make purple bar update roughly to position of navigation button
- Possibly make bar have sections (not sure how)
- Maybe remove the printout when thereâ€™s no results
