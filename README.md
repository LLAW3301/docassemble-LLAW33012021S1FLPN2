**Family Law Directory**

***Created by*** *Jessica Moncrieff, Michael Doroch, Ebony Algate, and Nathaniel Ramesh*
***Organisation:*** *Flinders University*

This application was created to assist couples, who are separating, in comparing and finding a family lawyer. The application will ask the user what region they are located in, and whether they require a lawyer who speaks another language. The application will then provide the user with a list of family lawyers matching their search criteria.

This application was created for, and in collaboration with,  the Family Law Pathways Network (SA), a  subsidiary of Relationships Australia (SA). Relationships Australia (SA) is a public company and not-for-profit organisation dedicated to providing Vulnerable Australians with Access to services. ABN: 19 119 188 500.
