  ##### The following is copied directly from the C3 app. Needs to be replaced


# The following code blocks each extract a set of agencies
# out of the qualifying agencies for display in a separate
# list.  This way we can display categories of agencies
# together (eg: Agencies that deal with pets, agencies
# that deal with ATSI etc).  The logic behind each block
# is that it:
# - iterates over all the qualifying agencies
# - if the relevant test is true then that agency gets added 
#   to the display list
# - the key 'printed' is set to true.  This makes sure we
#   don't display the same agency in more than one display
#   list.
